          <h2>Designer and Project Manager</h2>

          <p>Hi there! I am a Web and UX Design student interested in opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill base within this field.</p>
          <p>When I'm not supervising teams or completing coursework, you'll likely find me plunking away at my latest novel or short story. Writing is a passion of mine, and it allows me to express my creativity and share my thoughts with the world, when I have been fortunate enough to be published.</p>
          <p>I am always open to discussing potential opportunities!</p>

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>Since obtaining my first degree, I have had the opportunity to grow my professional skills through a variety of positions, primarily with Cognia. Going from a scorer to a Team Lead and currently to a Supervisor within two years, I've learned quickly how to stay organized, demonstrate leadership and responsibility for team members, and creatively solve problems as they appear. </p>
